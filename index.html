          <h3>Bathrooms</h3>
          <p>Working throughout the Northwest, my work splits between private homeowners and large building contractors requiring bathroom installations across the entire housing sector.

            With a huge background in general house refurbishments and home improvement, I can even carry out extreme associated building works like plaster skimming or new floor installations. I like to say “as little or as much as you need”; our new bathrooms service is all about offering you simple advice and suggestions before carrying out no more than you require.</p>

          <h3>Kitchens</h3>
          <p>Bathrooms By Gary offer kitchens that can give you a whole new feel at a fraction of the cost of refitting. My kitchen makeover's are the fast and affordable way to a beautiful new room.

            My Kitchen makeover is a quick, simple and lower cost way to completely revitalise a kitchen. With unit interiors often needlessly replaced, I offer simple solutions such as kitchen door replacements, kitchen unit replacements, fitted kitchens and new surfaces (including granite, stone, Getacore, laminates and many more) or even a new floor to give the space a completely new look without tearing everything out and starting from scratch.</p>
