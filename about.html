            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Between 2013-2018, I studied my GCSE's at St Peter and Paul Catholic College in Widnes. In which i recieved the grades of 1A, 3B’s, 4C’s (including English and math’s). During these years i picked up many skills towards Product Design, including the understanding and knowledge of CAD/CAM. From these years at my High School I was orginally wanting to go into contruction and joinery. Although over the years my family told me that I am great at using IT so why don't I go on and study a course doing computing, in which I did!</p>
            <p>Between 2018-2020, I got into St Helens college and started my studies doing a BTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Information Technology. In which I recieved Distinction<sup>*</sup>,Distinction<sup>*</sup>,Distinction<sup>*</sup>. From my studies at St Helens college I have developed many skills and a wider knowledge and understanding towards IT. This included that i now know how to develop a spreadsheet, develop a database, design and program a website and develop a basic python program. Through these years I also did all my exams to recieve my Microsoft Office Specialist Master Certificates. <a class="Certificates" href="https://www.youracclaim.com/users/harrison-liddell">View Here!</a></p>
